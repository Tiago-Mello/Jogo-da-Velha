App made unsing AngularJS version 9

This is a quick project that was meant only for practice using the framework. My goal here is to challange myself with something i have never done and to start to create new projects. This is my first time using Angular, or any framework so to speak, so i will take any suggestion to heart and improve myself with it.

Now for the project itself, it is a basic tic toc toe game that can be played by two people only, (no A.I) basically you have the main game, the option to start a new game, and you can even download it in your cellphone or desktop using a pwa app.

This is what the app looks like:
